1. The frequency occupies the frequency of 4kHz and has the bandwidth of 1kHz since (1/L)*(Fs/2) = 1000

2. Interpolation is not perfect resulting in aliasing which cant be removed perfectly by the low pass filter.

3. Interpolatio and decimation cause a phase shift of the signal which is different over the frequency domain.

4. 

5. Stopband attenuation, transition band width

6.
